# LSTM_for_Neural_Decoding

In this research we developed a recurrent neural network for decoding 2D position from spiking activity of a rat from its hippocampus while it moves in a W-shaped maze.
More details are available in our paper (A Comparison Study of Point-Process Filter and Deep Learning Performance in Estimating Rat Position Using an Ensemble of Place Cells).
